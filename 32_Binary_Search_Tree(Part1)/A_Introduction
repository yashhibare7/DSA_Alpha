Binary Search Tree (BST)

           S
         /   \
        B     T 

        Binary Search Tree is use for the  searching of data in logarithmic time complexity. (Use for minimum time complexity)

        O(N) ----> N for the no. of nodes

What is a BST?

        *Binary Tree
                                                                    4
        a.Left Subtree Nodes < Root                               /   \
        b.Right Subtree Nodes > Root                             2     5
        c.Left & Right Subtree are also                        /  \     \
          BST with no duplicates                              1    3     6

Special Property

        Inorder Traversal Of BST gives a sorted
        sequence i.e., smallest element at root, then 1,2,...,n-1,largest element in BST.

        Eg. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Insertion:
    - Find the position to insert new node by searching for the key in BST.
    - If not found, create a new Node and make it as left or right child of the parent node.
    - Repeat until we reach the leaf node.

Strategy

     Most porblem will be solved by using recursion i.e by dividing into subproblems & making recursive calls on    subtrees.

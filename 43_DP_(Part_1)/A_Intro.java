  # What is DP?

     DP is optimized recursion


  # How to identify DP?

    a. optimal Problem      
    b. some choice is given (multiple branches in recursion tree)

  # DP Definition

    Dynamic programming is a technique in computer programming that helps to efficiently slove a class of problems
    that have overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure property.

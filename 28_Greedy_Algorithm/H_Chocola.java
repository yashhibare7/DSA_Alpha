//Chocola Problem

//We are given bar of chocolate composed of mxn square pieces.One should break the chocolate into single squares.Each
//break of a part of the chocolate is charged a cost expressed by a positive integer. This cost does not depend on the 
//size of the part that is being broken but only depends on the line the break goes along.Let us denote the costs of
//breaking along consecutive vertical lines with x1,x2, ...,xm-1 and along horizontal lines with y1,y2, ...,yn-1.
//Compute the minimal cost of breaking the whole chocolate into single squares
